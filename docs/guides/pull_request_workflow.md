# Pull Request Workflow

This guide explains how to link issues with pull requests so that issues are automatically closed when the pull request merges.

## Reference the Issue

Create a GitHub issue describing the change before starting work. Mention the issue number in commit messages and the pull request body.

## Auto-close the Issue

Include a closing keyword like `closes #<issue>` in the pull request description. GitHub will automatically close the issue once the pull request is merged.
